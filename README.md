# Position sensitive PreciseRoIPooling
#### I implement Position sensitive PreciseRoIPooling (Caffe ver.) based on https://github.com/vacancy/PreciseRoIPooling
#### After training PS-PreciseRoIPooling based light-head rcnn model for 20000 iterationsï¼Œ I got a not bad result.
#### I do not have enough time making experiments on PASCAL VOC or COCO, If you got better results than PSRoi-align or PSRoi-pooling. Please let me know, thank you.
